      <h1>I'm Santa Claus!</h1>
      <p>Now what? Soon enough. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV,
        sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there
        and change your opinions manually!</p>
      <p>You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Then we'll
        go with that data file! <strong> No, just a regular mistake.</strong> <em> Kif, I have mated with a woman.</em>
        Inform the men.</p>
      <h2>I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!</h2>
      <p>No, she'll probably make me do it. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! I love you, buddy!
        Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or
        non-fatal?</p>
      <ol>

        <li>I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.</li>
        <li>Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</li>
        <li>Bender?! You stole the atom.</li>

      </ol>

      <h3 id="testimonials">I Will Eat this Cat If No One Responds</h3>
      <p>I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Hey, you
        add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy
        everything you ever believed in.</p>
      <ul>

        <li>What kind of a father would I be if I said no?</li>
        <li>Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</li>
        <li>We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.</li>

      <p>THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Whoa a real live
        robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from
        intestinal parasites?</p>
      <p>I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Hey, you add a one and two
        zeros to that or we walk! That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even
        love anyone pretending to be him!</p>
      <p>I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Look, last night was a mistake. No! The cat
        shelter's on to me. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or
        let you go.</p>
      <p>What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. I just
        want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. When the lights go out, it's
        nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.</p>
      <p>What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! I don't want to be rescued. How much
        did you make me? Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this
        money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?</p>

      <p>I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Say it in
        Russian! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!</p>
      <p>What kind of a father would I be if I said no? You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Fry! Stay back!
        He's too powerful! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have
        your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!</p>
      <p>Why would I want to know that? You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Okay, it's
        500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…</p>
      <p>Who are those horrible orange men? Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Negative, bossy meat
        creature! I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!</p>
      <p>Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Now, now.
        Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Ummm…to eBay? So, how 'bout them Knicks?</p>
      <p>Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or
        non-fatal? Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species:
        fatal or non-fatal?</p>
