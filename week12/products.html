            <p>Day 17, still no response. If this creature ever had an owner, I fear to think of what has become of them. We cannot leave, we cannot escape. There is no hope.</p>

            <h3>Drumming</h3>
            <p>We have barred the gates, but can not hold them for long. We cannot get out. They have taken the Bridge and the Second Hall. Frár and Lóni and Náli fell there. The pool is up to the wall at the Westgate. The Watcher in the Water took Óin. We cannot get out. The end comes. Drums, drums in the deep. They are coming</p>
