        <p>Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or
          non-fatal? And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Oh, you're a dollar
          naughtier than most.</p>
        <p>When will that be? Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! And I'd do it again! And
          perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Tell them I hate them. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public
          schools.</p>
        <p>Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? It may comfort you
          to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like
          fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.</p>

        <p>Throw her in the brig. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!
          You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!
        Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have
          to use the phrase "upside your head." Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>
        <p>Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. You don't know how to do any of those. Kids have names? Then throw
          her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".</p>

        <p>Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Leela's gonna kill me. Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.</p>
<p>I wish! It's a nickel. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Noooooo! But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.</p>
