  <h1>You're at the Peak!</h1>
  <p>You don't know how to do any of those. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! I'm just
    glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was
    only used to download pornography.</p>
  <p>Just once I'd
    like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Say it in Russian! Oh sure! Blame the wizards! But
    existing is basically all I do!</p>
  <p>Guess again. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Oh dear! She's stuck in an
    infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!</p>
  <p>Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school,
    so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!</p>
  <p>Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!
    The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house
    of cards. Checkmate.</p>
  <p>There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! No, of course not. It
    was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. She also liked to shut up! You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see!</p>
  <p>Tell them I hate them. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!
    Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until
    everyone died.</p>
  <p>This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Your best is an idiot! Actually, that's still true. You can
    crush me but you can't crush my spirit! No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.</p>
  <p>Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Bender, quit destroying the universe! Fry! Stay back! He's too
    powerful! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!</p>
  <p>Professor, make a woman out of me. I had more, but you go ahead. As an interesting side note, as a head without a
    body, I envy the dead. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!</p>
  <p>I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! So I really am important?
    How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!</p>
  <p>I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! When will that be? Well, then good
    news! It's a suppository. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!</p>
  <p>Shut up and get to the point! In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells,
    harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. No, she'll probably make me do it.</p>
  <p>Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Yeah, and if you were
    the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." You can crush me but you
    can't crush my spirit!</p>
  <p>Is that a cooking show? You can see how I lived before I met you. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a
    few fires! I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.</p>
  <p>OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? My
    fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter
    and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>
  <p>Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.
    Hey, whatcha watching? In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from
    perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p>
  <p>Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! Does anybody else
    feel jealous and aroused and worried? I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!</p>
  <p>Tell her she looks thin. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible
    ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social
    Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!</p>
  <p>Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. And I'm his friend Jesus. There's no
    part of that sentence I didn't like! That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. That's right, baby. I ain't your
    loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!</p>
