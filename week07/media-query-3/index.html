          <p>Can I use the gun? Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. You lived before you met me?! Bender, you risked your life to save me!</p>
          <p>Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!</p>
          <p>Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Large bet on myself in round one. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Of all the friends I've hadâ€¦ you're the first.</p>
