    <p>This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters
      announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! I'm a thing. Bender?! You stole the atom. We're also Santa
      Claus!
      Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN
      NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. Bender?! You stole the atom.
      Yeah, lots of people did. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Now Fry, it's been a few years since
      medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Pansy</p>

    <p>Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
      Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Bender?! You stole the atom. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously
      unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.
      We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! You can crush me but you can't
      crush my spirit! You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!</p>

    <p>Anyone who laughs is a communist! Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he
      pledged not to go on a killing spree. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe!
      Cause explosive decompression!
      <a href="http://www.duckduckgo.com">I haven't</a> felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. You can crush

      You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Anyhoo, your net-suits will
      allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.</p>
