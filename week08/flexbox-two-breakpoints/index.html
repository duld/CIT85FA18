    <p>Bite my shiny metal ass. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his
      wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. And when we woke up, we had these bodies.</p>
    <p>Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. <strong>
        Now what?</strong> <em> It must be wonderful.</em> I love you, buddy!</p>
    <h3>The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a
      house of cards. Checkmate.</h3>
    <p>I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. With gusto. I am Singing Wind, Chief
      of the Martians. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? And yet you haven't said what I
      told you to say! How can any of us trust you?</p>
    <p>Now what? Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Ow, my spirit! Meh. I had more, but you
      go ahead.</p>
    <h3>We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!</h3>
    <p>We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. I decline the title of Iron Cook and
      accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.</p>
    <p>Why would a robot need to drink? In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells,
      harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. For example, if you killed your
      grandfather, you'd cease to exist!</p>
    <p>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Hey, guess what you're
      accessories to. Shinier than yours, meatbag. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.</p>
